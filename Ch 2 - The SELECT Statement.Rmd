# The `SELECT` Statement

A SELECT statement is SQL code that retrieves data from the database.

# The Fundamental Syntax Structure of a `SELECT` Query

SQL SELECT queries follow this basic syntax, through most of the clauses are optional:

-   SELECT \[columns to return\]

-   FROM \[schema.table\]

-   WHERE \[conditional filter statements\]

-   GROUP BY \[columns to group on\]

-   HAVING \[conditional filter statements that are run after grouping\]

-   ORDER BY \[columns to sort on\]

# Selecting Columns and Limiting the Number of Rows Returned

```{r setup}
library(pacman)
p_load(dplyr, dbplyr, DBI)

# Create a database table in memory
farmers.db <- 
  dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
            group = "/Users/nickjenkins/Documents/Workshops & Conferences/SQL for Data Scientists/SQL for Data Scientists support files/FarmersMarketDatabase.sql",
            username = "root",
            password = "Hockeydude25",
            host = "localhost",
            port = 3306)
```

The simplest SELECT statement is

-   `SELECT * FROM [schema.table]`

where \[schema.table\] is the name of the database schema and table you want to retrieve data from. For example, `SELECT * FROM farmers_market.product` can be read as "Select everything from the product table in the `farmers_market` schema." The asterisk really represents "all columns" so technically it's "Select all columns from the product table in the `farmers_market` schema," but since there are no filters in the query (no `WHERE` clause), it will also return all rows.

The `LIMIT` clause sets the maximum number of rows that are returned. For example:

```{sql fig-2.1, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT * 
FROM farmers_market.product 
LIMIT 5
```

To specify which columns you want returned, list the column names immediately after `SELECT` separated by commas, instead of using the asterisk.

```{sql fig-2.2, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM farmers_market.product
LIMIT 5
```

```{sql fig-2.3, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT market_date, vendor_id, booth_number
FROM farmers_market.vendor_booth_assignments
LIMIT 5
```

# The `ORDER BY` Clause: Sorting Results

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the output rows.

```{sql fig-2.4, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM farmers_market.product
ORDER BY product_name
LIMIT 5
```

Now in descending order by `product_id`:

```{sql fig-2.5, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM farmers_market.product
ORDER BY product_id DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Now we can sort the output of the query of markets dates:

```{sql fig-2.6, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT market_date, vendor_id, booth_number
FROM farmers_market.vendor_booth_assignments
ORDER BY market_date, vendor_id
LIMIT 5
```

# Introduction to Simple Inline Calculations

Say we wanted to do a calculation using the different columns in each row. In the `customer_purchases` table we have a `quantity` column and a `cost_to_customer_purchases` column, so we can multiply those to get a price. Here is the raw data:

```{sql fig-2.7, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT
  market_date,
  customer_id,
  vendor_id,
  quantity,
  cost_to_customer_per_qty
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases
LIMIT 10
```

Now the calculation:

```{sql fig-2.8, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT
  market_date,
  customer_id,
  vendor_id,
  quantity,
  cost_to_customer_per_qty,
  quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases
LIMIT 10
```

To give the new column a meaningful name, we can create an *alias* by adding the keyword `AS` after the calculation and then specifying the new name.

```{sql fig-2.9, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT
  market_date,
  customer_id,
  vendor_id,
  quantity,
  cost_to_customer_per_qty,
  quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty AS price
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases
LIMIT 10
```

## More Inline Calculation Examples: Rounding

A SQL function is a piece of code that takes inputs that you give (which are called parameters), performs some operation on those inputs, and returns a value:

`FUNCTION_NAME([parameter 1], [parameter 2], â€¦, [parameter n])`

Here is an example with the `ROUND()` function.

```{sql fig-2.10, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT
  market_date,
  customer_id,
  vendor_id,
  ROUND(quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty, 2) AS price
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases
LIMIT 10
```

## More Inline Calculation Examples: Concatenating Strings

We can also use functions to modify string values. Let's say we wanted to merge each customer's name into a single column that contains the first name, then a space, and then a last name. We accomplish this using the `CONCAT()` function.

```{sql fig-2.12, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  CONCAT(customer_first_name, " ", customer_last_name) AS customer_name
FROM farmers_market.customer
LIMIT 5
```

And we can order the output:

```{sql fig-2.13, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  CONCAT(customer_first_name, " ", customer_last_name) AS customer_name
FROM farmers_market.customer
ORDER BY customer_last_name, customer_first_name
LIMIT 5
```

We can also nest functions. SQL executes the functions from the "inside" to the "outside." Let's capitalize the customer's names.

```{sql fig-2.14, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  UPPER(CONCAT(customer_last_name, ", ", customer_first_name)) AS customer_name
FROM farmers_market.customer
ORDER BY customer_last_name, customer_first_name
LIMIT 5
```

# Evaluating Query Output

A query editor can be used to review the results of a query. As an example, we'll use the "rounded price" query from earlier.

```{sql fig-2.16, connection = farmers.db}
SELECT
  market_date,
  customer_id,
  vendor_id,
  ROUND(quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty, 2) AS price
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases
```

# Exercises Using the Included Database

The following exercises refer to the `customer` table. The columns contained in the `customer` table, and some example rows with data values, are shown in Figure 2.11.

1.  Write a query that returns everything in the `customer` table

    ```{sql ex1, connection = farmers.db}
    SELECT * FROM farmers_market.customer
    ```

2.  Write a query that displays all of the columns and 10 rows from the `customer` table, sorted by `customer_last_name`, then `customer_first_name`.

    ```{sql ex2, connection = farmers.db}
    SELECT * FROM farmers_market.customer
    ORDER BY customer_last_name, customer_first_name
    LIMIT 10
    ```

3.  Write a query that lists all customer IDs and first names in the `customer` table, sorted by `first_name`.

    ```{sql ex3, connection = farmers.db}
    SELECT 
      customer_id, 
      customer_first_name
    FROM farmers_market.customer
    ORDER BY customer_first_name
    ```
